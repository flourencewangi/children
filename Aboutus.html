  <h1>ABOUT US</h1>


<div>
Tree of life children Ministries Ugandan Orphanage was conceptualized when the Director of the organization realized his dreams of trying to be able to support children who are socially alienated as a result of losing their parents due to AIDS. He is using Tree of life children ministries as a way to help children that find themselves in this predicament (an unpleasantly, difficult or dangerous situation). Most of these children are expelled from their households because other family members deem them unclean and contagious. Many members of the external families are usually not financially stable and can not care for these children. some parents are single  mothers because of separation they become drunkards end up  beating theses children and they  run away from their homes, some are bewitched go mad for the powers of God we pray for them they become settled in their souls come normal again.  This was a common practice in the communities he lived and worked in his home country Uganda. For socially displaced infants with no moral support, life becomes very challenging at such an early stage. This is the reason why the Director, who has dealt with these situations, is now lending a House to the many children whose fate can be changed through this Organization<p>

Tree of life children ministries concentrates on orphans and needy ones in the community and other parts of the country ,
Tree of life children ministries  is registered as a community based, multi purpose, and development group for orphans. It is regardless of race age, religious or ethnic background to provide basic accommodations, nutrition, education and to teach them the ways of the Lord so that their morals can be in the ways of fearing God.How to obey His only son Jesus Christ .<p>

Tree of life children home is a place where destitute children feel at home as they learn in Home-Schools environment. The community we serve has a population of over 500,000 (A large number of them are children). One third of the population is infected with HIV/AIDS. We are doing something to help, so people do not die without hope and smile.<br>
 We share the love of Jesus, as demonstrated in His Living Word. In a hands on, practical way. <p>

COMMUNITY 
God values relationships. He want you to be part of a community where people support and encourage children empowering them. The Bible shows us that Adam, the first man God created, experienced loneliness even though he was with God. Your faith has to be more than just between you and God. It needs to be lived out in the support, fellowship, and encouragement found in community with others.

A Word From the Director 

I started Tree if children charity Ministries International (TOLCM) in  2016. What started as  small with 2 as i disciple in different communities i found many children in the streets in villages then continued to add at my rented home  , added up to 15, by the power of the Holy Spirit into a ministry <p>

My hope because this place very small and these children don't study  
encompassing a network of a Bible school, children's homes (orphanage), primary education,  a medical assistance , constant evangelistic outreaches, farming and much more. If i  get a chance you and me can make a world a better place for theses little children to live in. <p>

Therefore in July  2017, me as the founder i had gone through the agony of losing one of my parent and other  relatives because of HIV/AIDS while I was still young I felt the God’s calling of doing his work and serve him through this orphanage ministry where by I could help other children who are motherless and father less Had been individually disturbed by the plight of many children in my community of Mityana, mubende Uganda, who had been neglected or abandoned and had no one and nowhere to turn to for help. After ,so I  created a space in our home to share what we had with the orphaned children here in my community. I would not live to see <br> children suffer after losing parents but would accommodate and live with them .This is  where i stepped out in faith to minister to the needs of the orphans , vulnerable children and families in my community. I  had nothing but a small house where i started with five (2)<br> children(orphans), who had been abandoned by their guardians . my prayers to bring a smile and new opportunities to hundreds of children in my  community.<p>

Since Tree of life children Ministry and orphanage Uganda  started in 2016 to shelter and educate children, it has undergone huge transformation and we are hoping to increase the number of children if we get Support and help from you. So we accommodate, and improve in the Education if we build our home and School. make farming for to feed the children so to ensure a sustainable future for the ministry and children . I want to use this ministry  to help more children here in my community and other communities.<p>
